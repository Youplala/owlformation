        "question": "What are the technical prerequisites?",
        "answer": "For most training courses, you will need a laptop with a stable internet connection. Some specific training may require the installation of free software that I will indicate in advance. No advanced technical skills are required - my training is designed for all levels."

        "question": "Are the training courses certified?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How many participants per session?",
        "answer": "To guarantee quality support, I limit my sessions to a maximum of 15 participants. This allows me to offer personalized follow-up to each participant and answer everyone's specific questions. For larger groups, we can organize multiple sessions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the content of a training?",

        "question": "What is the lead time to organize training?",
        "answer": "I can generally organize training within 2 to 4 weeks. For urgent requests, don't hesitate to contact me - I do my best to adapt to your constraints. The deadline may be longer if you go through OPCO funding (allow 4 to 6 weeks for file processing)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer follow-up after training?",
        "answer": "Yes! All my training includes post-training follow-up. Depending on the package chosen, you benefit from access to the Moodle platform (from 1 to 6 months) with course materials, additional resources and a help forum. I also remain available by email to answer your questions."
